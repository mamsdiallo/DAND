    "1. A PDF or HTML file containing your analysis. This file should include:\n",
    "    1. A note specifying which dataset you analyzed\n",
    "    2. A statement of the question(s) you posed\n",
    "    3. A description of what you did to investigate those questions\n",
    "    4. Documentation of any data wrangling you did\n",
    "    5. Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results\n",
    "2. Code you used to perform your analysis. If you used an Jupyter notebook, you can submit your .ipynb. Otherwise, you should submit the code separately in .py file(s).\n",
    "3. A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources)."

    "### Data Analysis Process\n",
    "This process could be iterative\n",
    "Principle: do not throw a feature until data analysis\n",
    "Principle: acquire more data you can.\n",
    "Principle: use the term feature instead of column\n",
    "### 1. Questions\n",
    "#### Q1. What are the most important factors to survival (e.g. Age, Sex, ...)?\n",
    "#### Q2. After splitting the data according to sex factor how the results differ?\n",
    "#### Q3. Does the marrital status or title - stored in name - count or not(i.e. Miss vs Mrs)?\n",
    "#### Q4. Correlation vs Causation for factors?\n",
    "#### Q5. Data Quality or accuracy among data and its impact?\n",
    "#### Q6. How to fill missing values or workaround?\n",
    "#### Q7. Fare meaning?\n",

    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. \n",
